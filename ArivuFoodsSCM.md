**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Detailed Requirements Gathering:** Conduct in-depth workshops to fully define all product data elements (Table 1\) and specific operational workflows.  
2. **Vendor Evaluation and Selection:** Research and evaluate potential SCMS software vendors specializing in food distribution (e.g., SOS Inventory, FoodReady AI, Infor CloudSuite, SYSPRO Food, BatchMaster ERP, JustFood ERP).4 Prioritize solutions offering strong MDM, batch tracking, expiration management, and flexible pricing capabilities.  
3. **Pilot Program Planning:** Develop a detailed plan for a pilot implementation, focusing on a specific product category or a limited set of retailers to test the system and refine processes before a full rollout.  
4. **Data Cleansing and Preparation:** Initiate efforts to clean and standardize existing product and customer data in preparation for migration to the new MDM system.  
5. **Team Alignment and Training Strategy:** Begin planning for comprehensive training programs and a change management strategy to ensure smooth adoption across the organization.

By embarking on this strategic SCMS journey, Arivu Foods will build a resilient, agile, and intelligent supply chain, capable of navigating the complexities of the food industry and supporting sustainable growth.
